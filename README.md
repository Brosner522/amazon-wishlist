# Amazon Wishlist


In this project you will find an `App.js` that renders both the `Wishlist` component and the `Products` component.

# Objective
With the products defined in the `App.js`, render those products in the Products Component. 

1. For each product, show at least the name and product.
2. Have a button for each product that when clicked, adds the name of the product to the wishlist.
